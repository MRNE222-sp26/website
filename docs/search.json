    "text": "Course description\nToday’s environmental challenges are increasingly complex and involve vast amounts of data. With technological advances that make ecological measurements cheaper and easier and open science tools that make data more accessible, the environmental field could even be described as “drowning in data.” In this course, students will learn how to use tools from statistics and computer science to gain insight from ecological data without “drowning” in it. We will draw practical real-world meaning from complex datasets by interpreting our analyses in the context of previous environmental or marine science coursework. Throughout the course, we will use literate programming and version control tools to ensure that our analyses are reproducible and accessible. We will do all of this using R, one of the most popular and in-demand statistical programming languages in the environmental and ecological fields.",

There are free online versions of all the textbooks, and R, RStudio, and GitHub are also free. Two information sources which we’ll use most frequently are:\n\nR 4 Data Science\nIntroduction to Modern Statistics\n\nHardware: You’ll need to bring a laptop to class and lab every day. Make sure to also bring a charger. If you don’t have a laptop, please talk with me so we can get you a loaner.\nSoftware: For computing, we’ll be using Posit Cloud, which lets you access RStudio and all of the packages we’ll need right from your browser. Although R and RStudio are freely available to download onto your computer, working from a central cloud version ensures that we spend our class time learning to code rather than trouble shooting software issues. All of your work should be done in our class Posit Cloud RStudio workspace. You will receive an invite to join the workspace during class.\nI do recommend that you download R and RStudio onto your computer at some point during the semester since you won’t have access to our cloud workspace after the course ends. You might also want to get your computer connected to GitHub so you can ask for help if you run into any problems. happywithgitr.com has very good instructions - be sure to follow them carefully and don’t skip any steps.",

    "text": "Assessment\n\nApplication exercises\nFrequently we will work on brief application exercises during class to practice new tools and concepts. The first few will be posted as assignments in our Posit Cloud workspace. When you open an assignment, Posit Cloud will make a copy for you. Your changes will be automatically saved and I’ll be able to see your work. After our first lab, you’ll clone the remaining Application Exercises from GitHub, work on them in Posit Cloud, and push your changes to GitHub to submit the assignment.\nApplication exercises should be submitted by the end of the week (Friday) in which they were assigned. Application exercises are evaluated as credit/no credit. To earn credit, the exercise must be:\n\ncomplete\nmostly (~80%) correct\nrendered into an html file with complete rendered file pushed to GitHub\n\nApplication exercises cannot be revised and resubmitted, so remember to check each assignment repo on GitHub to make sure your complete rendered file is showing up. If you’re having trouble, don’t hesitate to ask for help!\n\n\nLabs\nLabs provide time to practice the concepts covered in class and work collaboratively on group projects. Some exercises will be relatively brief and can be completed during the designated lab time. Others will be more involved and may need to be finished for homework. Either way, lab assignments should be submitted by the end of the week (Friday) in which they were assigned. Labs are graded on a scale of 0-3:\n\n3: Assignment is complete. There are no non-trivial errors. There are no code quality issues. This work could be used as a classroom example.\n2: Assignment is mostly complete. If there are errors, they are minor. It may contain code quality issues that need resolution.\n1: Work is incomplete, or there are significant bugs that affect the overall analysis. However, at least half of the problems are sufficiently addressed.\n0: Less than half of the problems are complete and/or correct. There is not enough work to provide meaningful feedback.\n\n\n\nRegrading lab assignments\nYou can revise and resubmit your lab assignments to earn the grade you want. The regrade process for labs is as follows:\n\nI will open an issue on your assignment repo to provide feedback on the assignment.\nMake the changes listed in the feedback.\nRender, commit, and push your changes to GitHub by the revision deadline.\nReply to the GitHub issue to say you’re requesting a regrade, also by the deadline, and tag me in the issue. If you do not request a regrade, I may miss that you want one and won’t process it.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou need to complete all of the labs assigned before the start of the group project in order to qualify to participate in the group project.\n\n\nYou need to complete all of the labs assigned before the start of the group project in order to qualify to participate in the group project. Because the labs are designed to help you learn and practice key coding and analysis concepts, they play an important role in preparing you for the group data projects. It wouldn’t be fair to your group members if you are not prepared to contribute meaningfully to the project. If you do not complete all of the labs leading up the the group project, you’ll need to complete the project on your own, which means you won’t be able to demonstrate one of the central course learning outcomes: collaborative coding.\n\n\nProject\nFinally, the course also includes an open-ended group project to give you the opportunity for you to demonstrate that you can ask a meaningful research question and apply the tools you have been learning to answer it using real environmental data. You’ll identify a topic with which you’re familiar from previous coursework to ensure that you have the disciplinary grounding needed to interpret your analysis. Your project must meet all of the specifications provided and you need to make substantial code contributions to your group’s work in order to earn at least a C in the course.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYour project must meet all of the specifications and you need to make substantial code contributions to your group’s work in order to earn at least a C in the course.",

    "text": "More policies\n\nAttendance\nIt is very important that you regularly attend class and lab. Everything we do builds on previously covered topics. That means if you miss class or lab, you will fall behind. I also know that life happens! If you need to miss class or lab, first make sure to communicate this with me. Then check the class schedule to see what you missed, review relevant slides and readings, and complete missed assignments on your own. If group-based project work took place, be sure to communicate with your team ASAP to come up with a plan for how you will contribute.\n\n\nLate work\nFor all assignments due on Fridays, you have an automatic 2-day extension and can submit them by the end of the day on Sundays (no need to ask). I am also usually flexible if you really need an additional day or two to complete an assignment. If that’s this case, just ask via email (so I don’t forget). If I don’t hear from you and I grade the assignment before you submit it, you’ll earn a 0. I can’t read your mind and it’s just not feasible for me to go back and check for missing work for all students.\n\n\nUse of AI\nGoogle is your friend and you should absolutely use it to help figure out coding questions, problems, bugs, etc. However, I’m a bit wary of AI tools like ChatGPT in an introductory course like this one. It can generate decent R code, but how much are you really going to learn if you blindly copy and paste whatever code ChatGPT generates? I want you to come away from this course being able to write your own code. ChatGPT is still not great at solving more complex coding problems. If you don’t understand how to write and debug basic code because ChatGPT gave you the answer, you’ll never be able to do the type of more advanced work that ChatGPT isn’t capable of doing for you.\nI don’t want to outright ban AI tools, but please be cognizant of your learning. Don’t let ChatGPT make you dumb–use it as a tool, not a crutch. And critically evaluate whether it’s giving you garbage or something useful.\n\n\nEngaged learning\nIn order to maintain the depth of learning that is required for a 4-credit course, some of your learning will take place by engaging with class material outside of normal lecture hours. Because the course includes a lab period, most of our “engaged learning” will take place via hands-on activities during lab.\n\n\nOffice hours\nOffice hours are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me during that time!",

For any other help call 240-895-4388, stop by Glendening 230, or email os3@smcm.edu. Asking for help is an important skill to learn. Students who seek assistance and use the resources we have on campus tend to do better academically, socially, and emotionally than the students who do not ask for help or use the resources. Let us provide assistance and support when you need it.\nThe Writing and Speaking Center: Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing & Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences—just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other.

If you have questions or need assistance, please contact Interim Director Amanda Taylor at apheatwole@smcm.edu.\nOffice of Title IX Compliance and Training: St. Mary’s College of Maryland is committed to helping create a safe and open learning environment for all students. If you (or someone you know) have experienced any form of Sex Discrimination, know that help and support are available. Sex Discrimination means exclusion from participation in or being denied the benefits of any education program or activity on the basis of sex, including sex stereotypes, sex characteristics, sexual orientation, gender identity, and pregnancy or related conditions. Sex-Based Harassment is a form of Sex Discrimination that includes the following types of conduct: quid pro quo harassment, hostile environment harassment, sexual assault, dating violence, domestic violence, and stalking.\nThe College strongly encourages all community members to take action, seek support, and report incidents of Sex Discrimination to the Title IX Office. Under Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, I am required to disclose information about such Sex Discrimination to the Title IX Office. If you would like to talk to a confidential employee who does not have this reporting responsibility, you can contact SMCM Wellness Center (240) 895-4289.\nFor more information about reporting options and resources at St. Mary’s College of Maryland and the community, please visit the Office of Title IX Compliance and Training.\nWellness Center: A growing number of students are experiencing mental health challenges to varying degrees. Doing what you can to stay ahead by wisely taking care of yourself will be a key to succeeding academically. Sometimes mental health challenges can affect your ability to complete required work. For example, a particular assignment might trigger anxiety for you in ways which were not anticipated. Or, maybe it becomes difficult to attend class due to mental health challenges. In any of those cases please come and talk with more or send me an email. I’ll listen and do what I can to help. The sooner you share your challenges with me, the better prepared I am to assist you. I am one of many people here at SMCM who care about you and your welfare.

    "text": "What and why\nThe goal of the project is to apply the techniques we are covering in class to a novel dataset in a meaningful way. The project should emphasize data wrangling, tidying, visualization, and statistical modeling. Bonus “points” if you use spatial data as well. We will cover statistics and spatial data after Spring Break.\nFor the project, you will analyze any environmental/ecological dataset you’d like, with the one requirement that it be related to a topic with which you are already familiar so that you have some domain expertise. Data analysis is usually most powerful if you have expertise in a relevant topic area and can, therefore, ask questions and draw conclusions that are well-grounded in that disciplinary domain. So this is a good opportunity to apply previous coursework or experiences in a new, more quantitative context.\nYou don’t necessarily need to do an exhaustive data analysis (i.e., do not calculate every statistic or visualize every variable), but rather demonstrate that you are proficient at:\n\nasking meaningful questions and answering them through data analysis\nusing R and GitHub to code collaboratively\npresenting and interpreting your results using literate, reproducible programming (i.e., Quarto)\nusing statistical analysis to draw rigorous conclusions\n\nTo that end, you should focus on your research questions and work backwards from there. Think about what types of analysis and visualizations will help you answer your question and how your data need to be wrangled or tidied in order to complete those tasks. You’ll probably need to do some initial exploratory data analysis to get a sense of what types of questions you might ask. As you enter the analysis stage, you can stick to the packages we learned in class (tidyverse) or push yourself explore others if they will improve your analysis. Finally, give careful thought to how you communicate your analysis. Neatness, coherency, and clarity are all important.\nIf at any point you are having trouble, don’t hesitate to ask for help before it’s too late. The main reason we have a lab session is so you can work while I’m in the room to provide immediate assistance. Take advantage of it!",

    "text": "Data\nIn order for you to have the greatest chance of success with this project it is important that you choose a manageable dataset. This means that the data should be readily accessible and large enough that multiple relationships can be explored. As such, your dataset should have at least 50 observations (rows) and between 10 to 20 variables (columns) (exceptions can be made but you must speak with me first). The dataset’s variables should include both categorical and numerical variables. If you are using a dataset that comes in a format that we haven’t encountered in class, make sure that you are able to load it into R as this can be tricky depending on the source. Please don’t reuse datasets we have already analyzed in class.\nBelow is a list of data repositories that might be of interest to browse. These are not all exclusively environmental data repositories, although some of them are. You’re not limited to these resources - you are welcome to identify your own datasets as well.\n\nTidyTuesday\nBikeshare data portal\nKaggle datasets\nAwesome public datasets\nHarvard Dataverse\nChesapeake Bay Program Data Hub\nUSGS National Water Information System\nUS EPA Toxic Release Inventory\nNSF Long Term Ecological Research Data Portal\nUS EPA Environmental Dataset Gateway\nNOAA National Centers for Environmental Information",

But learning how to fix them is an important skill. Embrace the messiness and try not to get too frustrated - I am here to help. Googling error messages is usually helpful as well.\nIt should go without saying, but everyone needs to make significant code contributions to each project. Because we are using Git and GitHub, I can see each person’s commits, including what you did and when you did it. So it is very obvious if one person is doing most of the work, for example, or another person waited till the last minute to make a few sloppy contributions.\nI know it’s tempting, but please do not write your code contribution in one .qmd file and paste it into your group .qmd file at the end of the project. It is importnant that everyone is working collaboratively on the same document. Each person needs to make commits regularly throughout the course of the project to demonstrate your consistent, continued contritutions.",

    "section": "Deliverables",
    "text": "Deliverables\n\nProposal\nIntroduction (2 paragraphs)\nThe introduction should introduce your general research question and your data. In the first paragraph, provide background information to introduce the topic. You should do some research and cite relevant sources to provide context that is grounded in the literature. For example, if I wanted to know whether there was evidence of increasing hurricane intensity in the storms dataset we have previously worked with, I would briefly review the scientific literature on why and how we know hurricanes are becoming more intense. The topic should be something you’ve already researched in some way so that you have enough expertise to spend most of your time analyzing your data rather than reading about your topic.\nIn the second paragraph, state your research question and provide a brief overview of your dataset (where it came from, how it was collected, etc.).\nPlease cite references parenthetically using author-date format (author’s last name, year of publication) using any citation style you’d like. APA is generally straightforward.\nData (1-2 paragraphs)\nProvide a more detailed description of your dataset, including names of files (if you have more than one), number of observations, and names of files. Then use the skim() function to provide a detailed summary of each dataset. Be sure to place your data in the `/data` folder of your project GitHub repository.\nData analysis plan (2-4 paragraphs)\nThis section should include a brief description of - The outcome (response, Y) and predictor (explanatory, X) variables you will use to answer your question, if applicable - The comparison groups you will use, if applicable - Very preliminary exploratory data analysis, including summary statistics and visualizations, along with some explanation on how they help you learn more about your data - The method(s) that you believe will be useful in answering your question(s). - What results from these specific methods are needed to support your hypothesized answer?\nReferences cited Include a list of any references you cited. You can use any citation format you’d like as long as the citations are clean and consistent. If you’re not sure, APA is a straightforward default.\nREADME file\nThe README file is like the home page of a GitHub repository. This is an important component of reproducible data analysis - someone should be able to access your GitHub repo, quickly learn what you did and why you did it in the README, and then access your analysis. Your project template includes a README.md template file. You should add your project title and author names to the README template, then populate the “Executive summary” and “Data dictionary” sections.\n\n\nReport\nThe report will more or less follow the same format as the proposal, with some additional content to contextualize your topic and present your results.\nIntroduction (at least 3-4 paragraphs)\nThe content should be the same as your proposal introduction, but with an additional 1-2 paragraphs to expand on your background information. Please aim to cite 3-5 information sources.\nData (1-2 paragraphs)\nSame guidelines as the proposal.\nMethods (2-4 paragraphs)\nThis section should include a description of the methods you used and why these methods were the right approach for answering your research question(s). Include any packages you used and provide a citation for each package. Start with a general overview of your approach, and then fill in the details. You don’t necessarily need to describe every single function you used and line of code you wrote. Focus instead on the big picture: why and how you wrangled the data, created new variables, calculated data summaries, made comparisons, identified relationships and patterns, etc.\nResults and discussion (at least 3-4 paragraphs but more is ok)\nThis section should present and discuss the results of your data analysis with an emphasis on how each of your results helps you answer your research question(s). Whereas a typical scientific paper generally includes separate results and discussion sections, here we will combine them to make the report more interesting and readable. It needs to include narrative text as well as code output (i.e., figures, tables, etc.).\nYou should organize this section around each of your key findings. Be sure to explain what each visualization is illustrating and how the ways in which the data are presented help to address your question. Discuss why we might be seeing particular patterns, relationships, trends, differences, etc. This is where your domain knowledge comes in again - you need to have a good sense of the underlying phenomena that are represented by your data in order to develop well-founded explanations. You may find that it will be helpful to cite additional information sources to help contextualize your results, but it really depends on the dataset, so these additional citations are optional. Please also include a discussion of the limitations of your analysis, what you would do if you had more time, etc.\nReferences cited\nSame guidelines as the proposal.\nREADME summary\nMake sure to update your README.md file so that it reflects the content of your final report.\n\n\nRepo organization\nThe following folders and files should be in your project repository:\n\nproposal.Rmd + proposal.md: Your proposal documents\nreport.Rmd + report.md: Your report documents\nREADME.md: your README file containing a project summary and metadata\n/data: folder containing your dataset(s) in CSV or RDS format\n\nYour repo should not contain any other files. You may find it useful to create some “scratch” files to do exploratory analysis or code testing outside of your project file. But these files should be removed from your final repository, and again be sure you are making regular contributions and commits to your group’s project file. Our goal is to create a clean, fully reproducible repository that could be made public. That means that only your final, well-documented work should be included.",
