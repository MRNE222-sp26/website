## Course description

Today's environmental challenges are increasingly complex and involve vast amounts of data. With technological advances that make ecological measurements cheaper and easier and open science tools that make data more accessible, the environmental field could even be described as "drowning in data." In this course, students will learn how to use tools from statistics and computer science to gain insight from ecological data without "drowning" in it. We will draw practical real-world meaning from complex datasets by interpreting our analyses in the context of previous environmental or marine science coursework. Throughout the course, we will use literate programming and version control tools to ensure that our analyses are reproducible and accessible. We will do all of this using [R](https://cran.r-project.org/), one of the most popular and in-demand statistical programming languages in the environmental and ecological fields.

## Course materials

**Readings:** All of the readings and software in this class are free and publicly available. There are free online versions of all the textbooks, and R, RStudio, and GitHub are also free. Two information sources which we'll use most frequently are:

-   [R 4 Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
-   [Introduction to Modern Statistics](https://openintro-ims.netlify.app/)

**Hardware:** You'll need to bring a laptop to class and lab every day. Make sure to also bring a charger. If you don't have a laptop, please talk with me so we can get you a loaner.

**Software:** For computing, we'll be using Posit Cloud, which lets you access RStudio and all of the packages we'll need right from your browser. Although R and RStudio are freely available to download onto your computer, working from a central cloud version ensures that we spend our class time learning to code rather than trouble shooting software issues. All of your work should be done in our class Posit Cloud RStudio workspace. You will receive an invite to join the workspace during class.

I do recommend that you [download R and RStudio](https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html) onto your computer at some point during the semester since you won't have access to our cloud workspace after the course ends. You might also want to get your computer connected to GitHub so you can ask for help if you run into any problems. [happywithgitr.com](https://happygitwithr.com/) has very good instructions - be sure to follow them carefully and don't skip any steps.

## Learning outcomes

At the completion of this course, students will be able to gain insight from marine and environmental data **reproducibly** and **collaboratively** using **modern programming tools and techniques**.

Specific outcomes include being able to:

-   visualize environmental data using `ggplot2`
-   wrangle and tidy data tables using `dplyr` functions to generate a suitable dataset for analysis
-   use functions and iterative programming to automate analysis tasks
-   define research questions and hypotheses
-   construct statistical models to quantify patterns and make predictions
-   interpret data in the context of prior knowledge in the environmental or marine science domains
-   communicate results and document code using Quarto documents
-   store data and code using a clean and clear system of organization
-   use version control tools (Git and GitHub) to collaborate and share code


## Assessment

### Application exercises

Frequently we will work on brief application exercises during class to practice new tools and concepts. The first few will be posted as assignments in our Posit Cloud workspace. When you open an assignment, Posit Cloud will make a copy for you. Your changes will be automatically saved and I'll be able to see your work. After our first lab, you'll clone the remaining Application Exercises from GitHub, work on them in Posit Cloud, and push your changes to GitHub to submit the assignment. 

Application exercises should be submitted by the end of the week (Friday) in which they were assigned. Application exercises are evaluated as credit/no credit. To earn credit, the exercise must be: 

* complete
* mostly (~80%) correct
* rendered into an html file with complete rendered file pushed to GitHub

Application exercises cannot be revised and resubmitted, so remember to check each assignment repo on GitHub to make sure your complete rendered file is showing up. If you're having trouble, don't hesitate to ask for help!

### Labs

Labs provide time to practice the concepts covered in class and work collaboratively on group projects. Some exercises will be relatively brief and can be completed during the designated lab time. Others will be more involved and may need to be finished for homework. Either way, lab assignments should be submitted by the end of the week (Friday) in which they were assigned. Labs are graded on a scale of 0-3:

* 3: Assignment is complete. There are no non-trivial errors. There are no code quality issues. This work could be used as a classroom example.
* 2: Assignment is mostly complete. If there are errors, they are minor. It may contain code quality issues that need resolution.
* 1: Work is incomplete, or there are significant bugs that affect the overall analysis. However, at least half of the problems are sufficiently addressed.
* 0: Less than half of the problems are complete and/or correct. There is not enough work to provide meaningful feedback.

### Regrading lab assignments

You can revise and resubmit your lab assignments to earn the grade you want. The regrade process for labs is as follows:

1. I will open an issue on your assignment repo to provide feedback on the assignment.
1. Make the changes listed in the feedback.
1. Render, commit, and push your changes to GitHub by the revision deadline.
1. Reply to the GitHub issue to say you’re requesting a regrade, also by the deadline, and tag me in the issue. If you do not request a regrade, I may miss that you want one and won’t process it.

You need to complete all of the labs assigned before the start of the group project in order to qualify to participate in the group project. Because the labs are designed to help you learn and practice key coding and analysis concepts, they play an important role in preparing you for the group data projects. It wouldn't be fair to your group members if you are not prepared to contribute meaningfully to the project. If you do not complete all of the labs leading up the the group project, you'll need to complete the project on your own, which means you won't be able to demonstrate one of the central course learning outcomes: collaborative coding.

### Project

Finally, the course also includes an open-ended group project to give you the opportunity for you to demonstrate that you can ask a meaningful research question and apply the tools you have been learning to answer it using real environmental data. You'll identify a topic with which you're familiar from previous coursework to ensure that you have the disciplinary grounding needed to interpret your analysis. Your project must meet all of the specifications provided and you need to make substantial code contributions to your group's work in order to earn at least a C in the course.

## Grading

Final grades are based on your mastery of course learning objectives, as demonstrated by your ability to meet all evaluation critera for each assignment. To receive a particular grade, you must satisfy *all* listed criteria. 

You can add a "+" on your final grade by meeting one or more of the lab or application exercise criteria for the next higher grade (i.e., if you met the B criteria but you earned a 3 on 70% of labs (one of the A criteria), you would earn a B+ instead of a B).

There are no "-" grades unless you fail to complete all of the lab exercises before the start of the group project and, therefore, need to complete the project alone. If that's the case, a "-" will be added to your final grade to reflect that you did not demonstrate mastery of the collaborative coding learning outcome.

**A**

* Earn credit for at least 90% of appliation exercises
* 2 or higher on all labs
* 3 or higher on at least 70% of labs
* No 0's on any labs
* Meets all specifications on course project

**B**

* Earn credit for at least 80% of appliation exercises
* 2 or higher on 80% of labs
* 3 or higher on at least 50% of labs
* No 0's on any labs
* Meets all specifications on course project

**C**

* Earn credit for at least 70% of appliation exercises
* 2 or higher on 70% of labs
* No more than 2 0's on labs
* Meets all specifications on course project

**D**

* Earn credit for at least 60% of appliation exercises
* 2 or higher on 60% of labs
* No more than 4 0's on labs

**F**

Fail to meet criteria for a D

## More policies

### Attendance

It is very important that you regularly attend class and lab. Everything we do builds on previously covered topics. That means if you miss class or lab, you will fall behind. I also know that life happens! If you need to miss class or lab, first make sure to communicate this with me. Then check the class schedule to see what you missed, review relevant slides and readings, and complete missed assignments on your own. If group-based project work took place, be sure to communicate with your team ASAP to come up with a plan for how you will contribute. 

### Late work

For all assignments due on Fridays, you have an automatic 2-day extension and can submit them by the end of the day on Sundays (no need to ask). I am also usually flexible if you really need an additional day or two to complete an assignment. If that's this case, just ask via email (so I don't forget). If I don't hear from you and I grade the assignment before you submit it, you'll earn a 0. I can't read your mind and it's just not feasible for me to go back and check for missing work for all students.

### Use of AI

Google is your friend and you should absolutely use it to help figure out coding questions, problems, bugs, etc. However, I'm a bit wary of AI tools like ChatGPT in an introductory course like this one. It can generate decent R code, but how much are you really going to learn if you blindly copy and paste whatever code ChatGPT generates? I want you to come away from this course being able to write your own code. ChatGPT is still not great at solving more complex coding problems. If you don't understand how to write and debug basic code because ChatGPT gave you the answer, you'll never be able to do the type of more advanced work that ChatGPT isn't capable of doing for you.

I don't want to outright ban AI tools, but please be cognizant of your learning. Don't let ChatGPT make you dumb--use it as a tool, not a crutch. And critically evaluate whether it's giving you [garbage](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-024-09775-5) or something useful. 

### Engaged learning

In order to maintain the depth of learning that is required for a 4-credit course, some of your learning will take place by engaging with class material outside of normal lecture hours. Because the course includes a lab period, most of our "engaged learning" will take place via hands-on activities during lab.

### Office hours

Office hours are set times dedicated to students. This means that I will be in my office waiting for you to come by talk to me during that time!

**Accommodations and Accessibility:** SMCM is committed to providing access to the learning and living experience to students with disabilities and disabling health conditions. If you have received a letter from the Office of Accessibility Services (OAS), which outlines the academic accommodations to which you are entitled to and you want those accommodations to apply to this course, you MUST share your letter and meet with me to review that letter. If you suspect that you have a learning or living need related to a disability or disabling health condition that could benefit from accommodations, you should contact the Office of Accessibility Services, who can help you learn more about how to proceed. Email: adasupport\@smcm.edu

**Office of Student Success Services:** The Office of Student Success Services (OS3) connects students to the resources, activities, services, and programs that can help students be successful, thrive, and persist to graduation. OS3 provides free tutoring services and academic coaching (strategies for time management, getting organized, overcoming procrastination, note-taking, test-taking, study skills, sleep and stress management, etc.) with professional staff and Peer Academic Success Strategies (PASS) Specialists. You may make appointments by emailing PASS\@smcm.edu. To request tutoring for a specific course, email tutoring\@smcm.edu. For any other help call 240-895-4388, stop by Glendening 230, or email os3\@smcm.edu. Asking for help is an important skill to learn. Students who seek assistance and use the resources we have on campus tend to do better academically, socially, and emotionally than the students who do not ask for help or use the resources. Let us provide assistance and support when you need it.

**The Writing and Speaking Center:** Located on the first floor of the main Library, the Writing & Speaking Center offers free peer tutoring in writing and speaking. The peer tutors are students themselves, but they have completed extensive hands-on training to learn how to assist their peers at any step of the process (planning, drafting, or revising) for any writing or speaking assignment. The peer tutors will not make decisions about revision for you and will instead work collaboratively with you to discuss ideas and consider options so that you can choose how best to revise on your own. This collaborative approach is one of the best ways to help students develop their abilities because all writers and speakers need audiences---just ask the peer tutors, who often schedule tutorials with each other. To make an appointment, please visit www.smcm.edu/writingcenter and click the "Schedule an Appointment" button. If you have questions or need assistance, please contact Interim Director Amanda Taylor at apheatwole\@smcm.edu.

**Office of Title IX Compliance and Training:** St. Mary's College of Maryland is committed to helping create a safe and open learning environment for all students.
